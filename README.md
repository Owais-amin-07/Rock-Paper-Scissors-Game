Rock Paper Scissor  Game
A web-based interactive game where users can play the classic Rock Paper Scissors against the computer. Built with:

HTML for the structure (buttons for rock, paper, scissors, and display areas for results).

CSS for styling (layout, colors, animations, and responsive design).

JavaScript for logic (random computer choice, game rules, and updating the score/results dynamically).

Players can click their choice, and the game determines the winner based on the rules. Itâ€™s a fun, lightweight project showcasing front-end development skills!
